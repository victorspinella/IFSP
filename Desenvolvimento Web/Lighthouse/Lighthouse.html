    <p class="texto1">Lighthouse can be run as a Chrome Extension<a href="#note1"><sup>1</sup></a>, from the command
      line, for used programmatically as a Node module. You give Lighthouse a URL that you want to audit, it runs a
      barrage of tests against the page, and then it generates a report on how well the page did.<q>From here you can
        use the failing tests</q> as <del>indicators on what you can do </del> to improve your app.</p>

        <h2>Setting up Lighthouse</h2>
        <p>There are two primary ways to run Lighthouse, as a Chrome Extension, or as a command line tool. The Chrome
          Extension provides a more user-friendly interface for reading reports. The command line tool enables you to
          integrate Lighthouse into continuous integration systems.<a href="#note2"><sup>2</sup></a>, Install the Chrome
          Extension <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">To install the extension, do the
            following</a> Or Chrome Extension.</p>

        <h2 class="chrome">Chrome Extension</h2>
        <p class="chrome_text">
          Go to the page that you want to audit <q>Click on the Lighthouse icon (Lighthouse icon) in the
            Chrome toolbar. You should see a</q> menu. If you want to only run a subset of the audits, click the Options
          button and disable the audits that you don't care about. Scroll down and press OK to confirm your changes <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">Extesion</a> Click the Generate report button to
          run
          Lighthouse's tests against the currently-open page.
        <p>The Lighthouse Viewer is a useful way for viewing and sharing reports, online. <a
            href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/">There are several ways to view a report</a>:</p>
        <p><em>The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence
            due
            to
            its enormous search space and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves.</em></p>
        <p>The Viewer also lets you share reports with others. Reports can be shared by clicking the share icon in the
          top
          right corner and signing in to Github. <q>Reports are stashed as secret gists in your account so you can
            easily
            delete or update the report later on.</q> Using Github for data storage also means free version control.</p>
